ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Welcome to my personal project repository.

Here you'll find a collection of projects I've worked on during university, freelance work, and in my free time, using tools like R, SQL, and Python. These projects reflect my interests in data analysis, problem-solving, and continuous learning.

Feel free to explore and thanks for stopping by!
